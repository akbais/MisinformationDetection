**Evaluate Trends in Misinformation on Twitter in the run-up to the 2020 US Presidential Elections**  
***Abstract*** 
Misinformation, alternative facts and falsehoods have all been used to describe consumable news both in social media and traditional news outlets. 
As social media, and especially Twitter, increasingly becomes the primary source of information for many Americans, having a way to determine the veracity of 
information reaching the people is more important now than ever. In this paper, utilizing natural language processing techniques such as Bag-of-Words (BOW), 
Bag-of-Ngrams, their TF-IDF variants and supervised learning models such as Multinomial Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression we will analyze Twitter data referencing 
the two presidential candidates, Donald Trump of the Republican Party and Joe Biden of the Democrat Party to evaluate trends in misinformation on Twitter in the run-up 
to 2020 US presidential elections. We seek to understand the differences in velocity of spread between real and fake news.
